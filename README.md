------------------------------------------------------------------------

The goal of *relate* is to identify cohort cluster with disparate
covariate information. This package uses unsupervised random forests to
obtain distances between observations within and across cohorts,
hierarchical clustering to identify sub-groups of cohorts, and then test
whether covariate distributions provide evidence differences in
multivariate joint distributions.
